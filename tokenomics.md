## <mark style="color:purple;">Blocked Liquidity:</mark>

For the safety of all holders who have given a vote of trust and to those who want to be part of the project's success reaping rewards in the future. We have decided to lock down liquidity so that they can have the full trust of the EVOC development team. Liquidity is locked for **100 years** via PinkSale, which is one of the best in the field for liquidity locks. We came to counter most projects where they end up destroying the projects themselves. And we're talking about excellent projects that could take on gigantic proportions.
