# ðŸ’° REWARDS

THE HOLDER MUST HAVE AT LEAST (10,000 EVOC) IN ORDER TO EARN SOME FRACTIONS IN ADA.

## **How does the distribution time of reflections work?**

**Below are two examples of trading volumes:**

1 . For example: if a mass of investors on the same day move an average of some 30 thousand dollars in purchases and sales of transaction fees, all holders receive on the same day. **Because the volume is too high!**

2 . In this next image you can see that the volume is much lower than the previous one. That is, it will take longer to receive the reflections, due to the fact that the volume of negotiations is very low. Distribution time may take **20 days or more.**&#x20;

**Note: Be patient, everyone who has more than 10,000 units of Evocardano will receive the reflections in ADA, all according to the volume of negotiations.**
