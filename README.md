# â„¹ Information

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Evocardano project has undergone a lengthy contract update and is improving the DEX. We will also be a platform for ICO launches to bring good liquidity to all of us. We apologize to everyone for the delay, but these changes were necessary. Those who have been with the project since the beginning know our entire history, our commitment, dedication, and transparency. We have achieved several accomplishments, such as CMC, CG, BigONE, CertiK, and Cardanoscan. We reached one million USDT traded in 24 hours, bringing much profit and appreciation to everyone. However, one of these listings brought us a lot of problems because it was a ghost exchange. With the support and influence of the community, we managed to get 500 signups requested by BigONE to be listed, which seemed like a free listing but ended up being very expensive. They drained some of our funds, leaving us with little USDT to continue marketing and concluding the project because all the money spent on the BigONE listing had no results. Another major problem was our contract, which lacked necessary functions to hold the sale and have control over the distribution of ADA rewards to investors. With the size of the problem we faced, any other project would invent an excuse and end the dream for everyone.

The Evocardano team thinks differently. We don't want to harm anyone, and the lives of thousands of people can be changed by just one coin, Evocardano Plus. The contract is already prepared, updated, and corrected, and we're coming with a new structure and a new goal to continue our story. It won't be different. We built a platform with a unique function, HARD FORK, which is already in effect ([evoclaunch.com](https://www.evoclaunch.com/)), and many people are already exchanging their old coins for the new ones. This function was created to make the lives of developers in web 3.0 easier and will be well-utilized by projects that need to update their contract and migrate from old contracts to new ones. We're coming with many exciting things, but we can't talk about them at the moment ðŸ˜Ž. Please wait and support the project. We'll be together until the first 100 million market cap in 24 hours ðŸš€.
