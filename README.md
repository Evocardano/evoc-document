{% endhint %}

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Trade

Instantly exchange crypto tokens: no registration or account required.

## INVESTOR‚ÄôS CHOICE&#x20;

The token is part of Binance Smart Chain, and has its own DEX network (decentralized exchange) being a fast platform with better usability in the market. It was created with the aim of eliminating many severe mistakes with slow transactions and fees from other exchanges, for that reason we created EVOCSWAP which makes a big difference and a better experience and a better approval of our investor‚Äôs.

## FEES&#x20;

Why pay more? EVOCSWAP is performed on BINANCE SMART CHAIN, a Exchange decentralized with costs of transaction then a pancakewap. The trading fees are also lower than any other networks like ethereum among others which are too expensive, as we came to bring better usability in your transactions.

## DECENTRALIZED&#x20;

Trade directly from your wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. EvocSwap does not hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own cryptocurrency.**
