# üê∂ Pinscher Coin Resume

**Pinscher Coin** is a token that will be launched on the Bscscan network, it is the governance token, the main token where investors will receive basic rewards for creating a liquidity pair and staking their tokens on the platform, rather than selling their coins. By doing so, they will receive more tokens as interest for helping sustain the coin's liquidity. Additionally, investors can potentially earn a lot through the appreciation of the token's value.

## PROJECT VISION

\
the main purpose of the Pinscher Token is to give users and investors the greatest amount of utility possible in addition to the quality of its construction.

With Pinscher Coin, you will be able to use our **Pinscher Swap directly with discounts, make Stakes of NFT's, use our exclusive artificial intelligence, be a member of our DAO, use our exclusive marketplace with discounts, farms and community pools**

At this very moment we already have several functionalities ready for use and more and more will be developed for the convenience of investors.

## INTRODUCTION IN THE NFT MARKET

One of the biggest and fastest-growing markets in the world today is the NFT market, and **Pinscher Coin** will become a currency for purchasing NFTs. On the Bscscan network, the team will introduce an NFT marketplace where any holder can create their own NFT, purchase it with **Pinscher Coin**, and become the owner, thus improving sustainability and creating a larger market cap volume for the coin. Holders can also sell their NFTs whenever they want.
