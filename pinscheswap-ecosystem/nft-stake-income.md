# ðŸ’¹ NFT Stake Fix

## STAKE VISION

Staking offers cryptocurrency investors a way to put their digital assets to work and earn passive income without having to sell them. It's like putting money into a high-yield savings account. When you deposit an amount into a savings account, the bank takes that money and typically lends it to other people. In return, you receive interest earned from the loans - although a very, very low percentage.

Similarly, when you stake your digital assets, you "lock" the coins to participate in blockchain execution and contribute to its security. In return for this, you earn rewards calculated as percentage yields. These returns are often much higher than any returns offered by banks.

Staking has become a very common way to profit from cryptocurrencies without trading them directly. In April 2022, the total value of cryptocurrencies staked exceeded the $280 billion limit, according to data provider Staking Rewards.

## NFT STAKE FIX

Exclusively designed by the project, NFT Stake will be valuable artworks and special rarities that will be released directly by the project, with utility to increase your staking percentage on the platform and receive Pinscher Coin as a reward. There will be five types of rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary and Ruby. With each collection released, the user will be able to become the sole owner of any NFT, which will have a starting value for purchase and specific APR% to increase their earnings.

Each NFT Stake has a starting price for investors to buy, and there is also a percentage reward for its usefulness. All the gear released by the project is collectible, and you can use as many as you like in your stake to increase your earnings. The larger the amount allocated in NFTs, the larger your earnings will be. The project can take months to release a collection, which reinforces the scarcity of the art and gives strength to the NFT market.
