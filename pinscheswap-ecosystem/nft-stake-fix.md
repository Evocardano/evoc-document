# ðŸ’¹ NFT Stake Fix

## STAKE VISION

Staking offers cryptocurrency investors a way to put their digital assets to work and earn passive income without having to sell them. It's like putting money into a high-yield savings account. When you deposit an amount into a savings account, the bank takes that money and typically lends it to other people. In return, you receive interest earned from the loans - although a very, very low percentage.

Similarly, when you stake your digital assets, you "lock" the coins to participate in blockchain execution and contribute to its security. In return for this, you earn rewards calculated as percentage yields. These returns are often much higher than any returns offered by banks.

Staking has become a very common way to profit from cryptocurrencies without trading them directly. In April 2022, the total value of cryptocurrencies staked exceeded the $280 billion limit, according to data provider Staking Rewards.

## NFT Stake Fix

Exclusively designed by the project, NFTs with valuable artworks and special rarities will be launched directly by the project, with utility for you to increase the percentage of your stake within the platform and receive **Pinscher Coin** as a reward. There will be three types of rarities: Rare, Ruby, and Legendary. With each collection launched, you can become the sole owner of any NFT, which will have an initial value for you to purchase and specific APR% percentages to increase your earnings.

Each NFT Plus has an initial price for investors to buy, and there is also a percentage of rewards for their utility. All art released by the project is collectible, and you can use as many as you want in your stake to increase your earnings. The higher the value allocated in NFTs, the lower the APR%, but the advantage is that not all NFT Plus will be released at once. The project may take months to launch a collection, which strengthens the scarcity of the art and gives them strength in the NFT market.
