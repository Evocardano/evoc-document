# ðŸ”€ HardFork

The platform, exclusively designed by the project for smart contract updates, features an automated system that facilitates the exchange of currencies from old contracts to new ones. In other words, if there is any issue or error identified in a contract, the platform provides ample support to update any project by linking an old contract to a new one. Any developer can utilize this service by creating and paying a basic fee of 2 BNBs on the platform. The system also includes an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of creating a hardfork on its own. The creation process involves specifying the old price, new price, start date, end date, and a bonus if you wish to reward your community. You can make edits in the "owner/creator" tab anytime by simply connecting your wallet.

## CREATING A HARDFORK&#x20;
