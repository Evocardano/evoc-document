# ðŸŸ£ EVOCARDANO

## About The Project

EvoCardano is a token that has already been launched on the BSC network (Binance Smart Chain) but will also be launched on the Cardano network. Where after the Alonzo update gets to 100%, it will be allowed to trade Defi's projects on the Cardano blockchain. It is believed in the possibility of eliminating bugs and hacks in DeFi's projects. With this, EvocSwap emerges, which is the development of a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) similar to Pancakeswap for the two networks. Where it will allow users to trade assets, quickly, cheaply and safely.

## Project Visions

Our vision is to implement our ecosystem on Cardano's own blockchain. Doing so, the union of capitalization of the two networks. Like that we can have an extreme valuation with the union of the two networks in EvoCardano and PowerEvoc. The crucial point and the importance of actually being a holder of this project is that after joining the market capitalization of the two networks in our currencies, we can have an extreme appreciation. And it will be there that investors who have always believed in the project, will achieve the goal they always dreamed of.
