# ðŸ«‚ Affiliate System

An affiliate system is an online marketing strategy in which an individual or company promotes another company's products or services and receives a commission for each sale or action generated by their promotion. It is a form of partnership in which the affiliate acts as an intermediary between the product producer and the end customer, being compensated for their ability to generate results for the producer. This system has become increasingly popular among companies, particularly those operating in e-commerce, as an efficient way to increase sales and expand their online presence.
