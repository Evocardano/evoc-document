# ðŸ’² Pinscher Launchs

Pinscher Launch is a secure and controlled platform for launching new cryptocurrency projects. Anyone can use the platform to develop and launch their own project. By participating in a launch on the Launchpad, investors gain early access to the new cryptocurrency and the opportunity to purchase tokens at a discount.&#x20;

Additionally, the project development team can benefit from the broad exposure and credibility that the launch platform offers, which can help increase the adoption and success of the cryptocurrency in the market.

The fee you pay to conduct a pre-sale of your project on our launchpad is 1 BNB + 5% of the total BNB raised in your pre-sale. Pinscher Launch does not retain a percentage of your tokens, unlike other launchpads that retain 2% to 4% and end up selling them during the launch, which can harm your project.  and we are in the process of developing partnerships with KYC and Audit companies.

We are structuring our launchpad with the goal of becoming one of the most utilized launchpads in the market, with AI systems and cross-chain capabilities across various networks. Additionally, our main token, (PINSCHER), will have 40% of the platform's profits allocated to its liquidity pool and burned every month, ensuring further appreciation of our currency.

Pinscher Launch has one of the best systems for securing your investment. The platform only releases liquidity to the developer after the completion of the claim process, meaning that they only gain access to the invested funds after the coins are in your wallet. Additionally, the developer has the freedom to cancel the pre-sale, and the platform will refund all the funds invested by the users by releasing the claim for reimbursement.

* TO ACTIVATE THE PURCHASE METHOD VIA (PIX), THE PROJECT MUST UNDERGO KYC AND AUDIT ON THE PINSCHER LAUNCH PLATFORM.
* PROJECTS THAT ACT IN BAD FAITH AND ARE PROVEN BY ANALYSTS TO HAVE COMMITTED FRAUD, DESPITE HAVING THE KYC SEAL ON THE PLATFORM, WILL HAVE ALL DATA EXPLAINED TO BOTH COMMUNITIES.

While there may be malicious developers, and you are always fully responsible for your investment, the security of the platform is guaranteed. However, we do not guarantee security once liquidity has been transferred to the developers of the project in which you are investing. For this reason, always try to filter all the projects you are investing in, study the project and the people behind it before you invest your money.
